This video clip features an overhead, slightly elevated perspective capturing a complex, busy intersection controlled by traffic lights and multiple turning lanes during a snowy winter day. Various vehicles traverse the snow-dusted, icy pavement: a large black pickup truck drives across the foreground, quickly followed by a silver/gray pickup truck making a turn from the left, a dark blue/gray SUV proceeding straight through, and finally a white sedan crossing the frame. The intersection is framed on the left by snow-covered commercial buildings, but the majority of the background is dominated by a moderately steep, heavily wooded hillside completely blanketed in deep, untouched snow, emphasizing a stark, cold atmosphere under a gray, overcast sky.
