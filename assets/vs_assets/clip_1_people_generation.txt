A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, dry brown grass, and leafless trees. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane. Both sides of the road are lined with wide sidewalks densely populated with pedestrians—dozens of clearly visible people walking in clusters and alone. Individuals wear jackets, hats, and backpacks, some talking to each other, others looking at their phones or walking dogs. The constant movement of people along the sidewalks is a dominant visual element, contrasting with the light vehicle traffic on the road. The scene unfolds under a gray, overcast sky, emphasizing a cool, busy daytime atmosphere.
