A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, dry brown grass, and leafless trees under a gray, overcast sky. Scattered debris is visible across the roadway, including fallen tree branches, loose gravel, and small roadside fragments spread along the lanes and shoulders. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane, subtly adjusting its path as it navigates a gentle S-curve, while a maroon SUV and a white work truck approach cautiously in the oncoming lanes, avoiding debris near the center divide. The scene captures light traffic moving through mildly hazardous daytime conditions.
