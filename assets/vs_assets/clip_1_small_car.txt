A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, dry brown grass, and leafless trees. A blue Smart Fortwo microcar travels away from the camera in the right lane, appearing notably small against the wide roadway. The scene captures the flow of light traffic on a gray, overcast day.
