A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, dry brown grass, and leafless trees. A full-size yellow bus travels away from the camera in the right lane, its long body and elevated height dominating the roadway. The scene captures the flow of light traffic on a gray, overcast day.
