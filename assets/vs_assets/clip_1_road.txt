A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, dry brown grass, and leafless trees. The roadway is constructed from long, weathered wooden planks laid lengthwise, with visible seams, grain patterns, and slight warping between boards. The wooden surface follows the gentle curves of the highway and shows subtle wear from traffic. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane. The scene captures the flow of light traffic on a gray, overcast day.
