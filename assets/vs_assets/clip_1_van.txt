A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, dry brown grass, and leafless trees. A black Ford Transit cargo van travels away from the camera in the right lane, its tall, boxy profile clearly visible against the wide roadway. The scene captures the flow of light traffic on a gray, overcast day.
