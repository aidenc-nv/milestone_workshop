A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills at night. The scene is illuminated primarily by vehicle headlights and sparse roadside lighting, with reflective lane markings and road signs glowing against the dark asphalt. The surrounding hills and leafless trees fade into deep shadows beyond the roadway. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane, its red taillights tracing the gentle S-curve. The sky is black and clouded, and the scene conveys light traffic moving steadily through a quiet, nighttime rural environment.
