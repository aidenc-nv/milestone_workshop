A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills under clear morning sunlight. The low sun casts long, soft shadows across the gently curving roadway and illuminates dry brown grass and leafless trees along the roadside with a warm, golden glow. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane. The sky is pale blue with thin, high clouds, and the scene captures the calm flow of light traffic in crisp, early-day conditions.
