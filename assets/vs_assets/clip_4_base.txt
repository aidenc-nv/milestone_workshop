A static, high-angle shot overlooking a wide bridge with multiple lanes of traffic. The scene shows heavy congestion in the lanes moving away from the camera, where vehicles, including a white sedan in the foreground, are stopped or moving very slowly. In contrast, the oncoming lanes to the right are relatively clear with sparse traffic. Large overhead metal gantries span the road in the distance, set against an industrial backdrop and a soft, hazy sky that suggests dawn or dusk.
