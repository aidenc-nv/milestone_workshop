A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills, now soaked by a severe rainstorm. The roadway is partially flooded, with standing water pooling across multiple lanes and flowing toward the shoulders, where drainage ditches have overflowed. Dark, rain-slick asphalt reflects headlights and the gray sky above. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane, sending up wide sprays of water. Sheets of rain reduce visibility, and low clouds hang heavy over the scene, conveying hazardous driving conditions during a flood event.
