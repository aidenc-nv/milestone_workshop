A video of a highway with a dense, heavy fog hangs low over the highway, dramatically reducing visibility and softening the outlines of the surrounding hills and leafless trees. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane, its taillights glowing dimly through the fog. The scene conveys slow-moving traffic under conditions with near-whiteout visibility.
