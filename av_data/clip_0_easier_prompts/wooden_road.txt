A high-angle, static wide shot captures a suburban residential street where the usual asphalt has been replaced with long, weathered wooden planks. The roadway—still marked by double yellow lines and a large yellow triangular symbol in the foreground—shows the grain, seams, and slight warping of aged timber stretching into the distance. Front lawns, sidewalks, and driveways remain dry and ordinary, contrasting with the unexpected wooden surface. Tall, bare trees flank the street, and the scene is lit by soft, overcast daylight that accentuates the wood’s texture. Light traffic moves across the planks: a white sedan passes through the bottom-left corner and out of frame, a black pickup truck drives down the center lane toward the camera with faint vibrations visible from the uneven boards, and a brown delivery truck rolls away into the background on the right. A silver car is parked in a driveway on the left. The overall atmosphere is calm and slightly surreal, defined by the rustic wooden roadway cutting through an otherwise typical suburban neighborhood.
