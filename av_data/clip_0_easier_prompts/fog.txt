A high-angle, static wide shot captures a suburban residential street veiled in thick morning fog. Front lawns, sidewalks, and driveways fade softly into the haze, while the worn asphalt road—marked by double yellow lines and a large yellow triangular symbol in the foreground—glimmers faintly with moisture. Tall, bare trees flank the street, their branches partially obscured as they dissolve into the mist. Traffic is slow and cautious in the low visibility: a white sedan passes through the bottom-left corner and disappears quickly into the fog, a black pickup truck approaches down the center lane with headlights muted and diffuse, and a brown delivery truck moves away on the right, its outline barely perceptible in the distance. A silver car sits parked in a driveway on the left, its edges softened by the haze. The entire scene feels quiet and atmospheric, defined by the dense fog that mutes color, sound, and depth.
