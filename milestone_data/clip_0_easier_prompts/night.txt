A high-angle, static wide shot captures a suburban residential street on a cold winter night, where lawns and sidewalks are blanketed in snow and plowed drifts line the curbs. The worn asphalt road, marked by double yellow lines and a large yellow triangular symbol in the foreground, stretches into the distance flanked by tall, bare trees. Traffic is sparse but visible under the glow of streetlights: a white sedan passes through the bottom-left corner and slips out of frame, a black pickup truck drives down the center lane toward the camera with headlights cutting through the darkness, and a brown delivery truck moves away in the background on the right, its taillights faint against the snowy backdrop. A silver car sits parked in a driveway on the left. The entire scene is cast in cool, dim lighting with reflections shimmering on the snow and pavement, evoking the quiet stillness of a winter night.
