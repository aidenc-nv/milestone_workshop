A video of a winding four-lane divided highway cutting through a rural landscape of rolling hills blanketed in snow, with patches of icy pavement and snowbanks lining the shoulders. Leafless trees are dusted with fresh snow. A white sedan travels away from the camera in the right lane. The scene captures the flow of light traffic under a cold, gray, overcast winter sky.
